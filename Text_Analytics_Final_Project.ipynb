      "[NEGATIVE (0.9999)] I recently stayed for 4 nights and over all I enjoyed my stay but I would not stay again The first thing and the main problem is the sewage smell in the bathroom that is so bad it stenches through your hotel room and on to all your belongings Having asked about it and waiting for room service I had to reask before someone came to my room Very efficiently they lifted the drains in the bathroom and proceeded to bleach the pipes a common thing they tell me although it isn t stated on their website The smell went but would still come back so rather than uphold my holiday plans any further by waiting I would advise to squeeze bleach or shampoo down the shower grill on a regular basis or you will never enter the bathroom again Even the cleaners were gagging I also wasn t aware that you share the hotel with residents people that actually reside in the building on a regular basis and directly next door is a mental institution so be aware again that when you book you may be accosted by these people on your travels they mean no harm but it is very daunting if you are not comfortable with these situations The hotel offers room service but not with breakfast which I found surprising and as a private person who didn t want to join others for breakfast I could not find any where near that did a good English breakfast However Cafe Bratavia on central station do one to die for you must try it and only 9 50 The room was cold the tv only has Dutch channels very scarce to find an English programme and you only get cushions to sleep on not pillows If we sat on our balcony we could see the people in the room next door use their toilet as the bathroom is directly in the window where we sit I was forced to inform the gentleman that I had seen everything when he went to the toilet It is not an ideal situation and very inappropriate.\n",

      "[POSITIVE (0.9997)] We arrived at the hotel at 9 30am and we wanted to drop our bags so we can go and explore the attractions nearby Our room was already available so we got straight in unpacked and on our way Such a lovely start of our trip Brill location for attractions by foot and tube station is only 5 mins away Choice of restaurants In the hotel and they are not too expensive and taste amazing Clean and modern rooms will definitely return\n",
      "[NEGATIVE (0.7129)] I stayed in one of the most basic rooms The bathroom was split between shower and toilet which were very small and had direct access to the room It was perfect for a solo traveler but may have been a concern in terms of privacy if having a companion.\n",
      "[POSITIVE (0.9998)] I was stuck in Barcelona because of a delayed flight so I had to book something for the same night Room was clean and comfortable The Sci Fi theme carried throughout the hotel made me chuckle the right hint of humor Staff were very polite and helpful The breakfast buffet is pricey but delicious and it has plenty of variety Oh and right on top of Sants train station so awfully convenient if arriving departing from there\n",

Had booked classic double room which is really really small and not worth the price that we paid 296 300 Euro roughly for 2 nights We had to move to superior bedroom at our own cost 14 euro extra per night the bed is comfortable modern and facilities in the room is excellent The hotel is centrally located with easy access to Metro I would again request the hotel management staff to put realistic picture of classic double room and please please inform the guests well ahead about any renovation work that is going on in your hotel This would atleast set the expectation We were really disappinted when we entered our room and had to immediately pay for an upgrade</td>\n",

Nothing at all    \n",
       "258     We had initially booked a classic bedroom but only to find out when we arrived that the room was very very small for even 2 people too pricey for classic bedrooom We had to pay extra to upgrade for a superior room of a decent size If I had known the size of the classic bedroom I wouldn t have booked it at all The photos of the classic bedroom you find here is not realistic I was really disappointed The other issue was the hotel is undergoing renovation and we weren t informed about this There is no breakfast room available Our total price for the 3 nights stay was 700 Euros which is too pricey for this hotel. Had booked classic double room which is really really small and not worth the price that we paid 296 300 Euro roughly for 2 nights We had to move to superior bedroom at our own cost 14 euro extra per night the bed is comfortable modern and facilities in the room is excellent The hotel is centrally located with easy access to Metro I would again request the hotel management staff to put realistic picture of classic double room and please please inform the guests well ahead about any renovation work that is going on in your hotel This would atleast set the expectation We were really disappinted when we entered our room and had to immediately pay for an upgrade    \n",
